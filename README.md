## How it works
This project is a simple sorting and packaging system. There are three materials which are 
blue, green and metal. They are sorted based on their color. After sorting process is done, they 
are fell into the boxes for packaging. After three items are stacked in the box, pusher is 
pushed the box to the dispatch area and the box will be collected here. In order to start the 
operation, operator must press the start button on the electric switchboard. There are also stop, 
reset and emergency button on the electric switchboard. If operator press the stop button, the 
operation will be stopped. If the operator presses the emergency button, the operation will be 
also stopped but in order to start the operation again, operator must switch back the 
emergency button then press the start button. The reset button will reset the operation. Also, 
there is safety door. When safety door opens, operation will be stopped and warning light and
